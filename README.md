> **Note:** You might get a prompt saying "Windows has protected your PC". In this case, click `More Info` and `Run Anyway`.

> If you're unsure about the safety of this app, I would suggest running it through a service like [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com).
> It's also worth noting that this project is fully open-source, which means any developer could look at the code and easily spot any malware.

## Building from source

### Windows

Firstly, make sure you have done all of the [Tauri prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites).

Additionally, make sure you have git and the tauri CLI installed (or install it with `cargo install tauri-cli`).

After you have cloned the repository, run the following to start a dev server:
```sh
npm install
cargo tauri dev
```
To build Gale, run:
```sh
cargo tauri build
```
After a while, it will output both an .msi and an .exe installer in the `src-tauri/target/release/bundle` folder.

> If you want to modify/distribute the app, keep in mind the [license](/LICENSE).

### Linux

**Install the required tools and build chain**

> **Note:** The examples use a Debian flavor package manager. Use your system specific package manager such as Yum or Pacman instead.

To build Gale on Linux you will likely require the following packages:

**Rust Dependencies**

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    wget \
    file \
    libssl-dev \
    libgtk-3-dev \
    libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
    librsvg2-dev
```

**Cargo/Rust**

```sh
sudo apt install cargo
```

**NVM**

If your system does not have the latest node available you can install nvm by following the instructions [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/).

You can install a version of node that will work with Gale by using:

```sh
nvm install 20
```

Then you set the node version for your current terminal by using this command:

```sh
nvm use 20
```

You will need to set your node version before using any NPM commands later in this guide.

**Install the Tauri CLI**

```sh
cargo install tauri-cli
```

This will take a while, especially if you've never compiled anything with Rust before.

**Start the dev server**

```sh
nvm use 20
npm install
cargo tauri dev
```

**Build Gale**

```sh
cargo tauri build
```
After a while, this it will output both an executable and an installable package (a .deb for debian-based systems) in the `src-tauri/target/release/bundle` directory.
